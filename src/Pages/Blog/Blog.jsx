                              <p>The use of sunglasses dates back to ancient Rome and China, where emperors and judges used flat panels of smoky quartz to shield their eyes from glare. Sunglasses as we know them today, with dark lenses and frames, became popular in the early 20th century. They were initially designed for protecting the eyes from harmful UV rays and reducing glare, but they quickly evolved into a fashion staple.</p>
